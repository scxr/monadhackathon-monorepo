Man, looks like crypto is here to stay, just like every other business that ever bought a super bowl ad.
Token crypto itu pada dasarnya kan tech startup, yang dijual adalah teknologi dan atau utility.
Checking in with white feelings about the halftime show has been wild, y’all. It’s a freaking musical number to break up the monotony of crypto ads and Gladiatorial combat. 
Not to philosophize or whatever but y’all, there was a lot wrapped up in that Super Bowl. So much to be said &amp; written.
Ended up counting 7 total Super Bowl electric car related commercials:
Every crypto commercial has the desperation of “I gotta get more people to join my downline otherwise what am I gonna do with all these leggings?”
this crypto thing is going to be such a bloodbath. i feel like extremely unstable assets in a free for all market that is 95% scam and grift sold to regular humans as valuable secure investments by celebs on tv isn't a story that has any sort of good end
Both quarterbacks are hurt, a game-breaking receiver has left the game, a blown call has altered the outcome, one coach will not stop running the ball, Eminem has a beard, Larry David is selling crypto…
Celebrities starring in crypto ads should have to disclose if they were paid in crypto or in real money.
nobody: 
Ben Affleck doing gambling ads. Matt Damon doing crypto. I didn’t have the kids from Good Will Hunting rising to a stratospheric level of fame and fortune, and then choosing to pick the meat off the bones of what’s left of this economy.
‘Tired of losing money on crypto? Perhaps online betting is for you.’
This is your reminder that 10% of Bitcoin owners have 99% of the bitcoins. They need new crypto buyers to be able to sell their holdings without tanking the market. All of these crypto ads are them trying to offload their position in the Ponzi scheme.
They’re really really putting millions of dollars into trying to get you to feel FOMO over crypto, huh? Can you think of a reasonable, worthwhile, durable investment that they had to beg regular folks to participate in?
Nice to see any CO2 emissions reduced by all these electric car ads will be offset by all the crypto ads
One reason I still have trouble believing crypto currency is money is that there aren’t commercials for money.
Lord of the Rings trailer ending with Gandalf turning to the camera and explaining that he gets his magic from crypto
All these celebrity crypto ads are destined for a supercut montage in the inevitable documentary after the recession
Rams averaging fewer yards/carry than the number of crypto commercials seems bad
crypto ads noticeably hesitant to explain what, exactly, the product is
Feels illegal for there to be this many Crypto ads
The crypto ads this year are highly reminiscent of all the dot-com ads we saw in 2000, right before the market came crashing down.
You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself doing crypto ads
Larry David doing Crypto commercials gotta be some form of elder abuse.
Larry David doing crypto commercials. Damn. Knew that was coming at the end but still felt the full force of that L.
Larry David in a crypto ad is a pretty succinct answer to “Is it ever possible to have enough money?”
Larry David being in a crypto commercial is the single most devastating thing to ever happen to me please give me space to process.
Crypto is so thirsty…
Larry David doing a crypto ad has broken my boyfriend, I’m afraid we’ll never recover from this

Every celebrity in a crypto ad should be required to disclose if they took their fee in crypto, or if they asked for regular old cash / took it in crypto but immediately sold it all for cash.
With inflation at 7.5%, you lose half your money in 9 years. The only way to outperform that consistently, that I have found, is crypto. Just this year I’ve already lost half my money.

My only crypto take is that if you don't find some of it incredible you're not paying attention and if you don't find a lot of it absurd you're not paying attention.
Crypto is no longer just a niche vertical industry. It is the base layer that powers/funds many other industries.
Invest in both new and old, and bridge them with crypto.

Welcome to Crypto🚀
This was a big week!
I don't care what NFTs you own or how much profit/loss you have, if you are in the Crypto/NFT space right now and understand the movement then you are going to make it. That simple.
A very common experience in crypto/web3 is to have a friend who was previously dismissive — “it’s all scams” — become a convert after “going down the rabbit hole.”
The relationships I've forged through crypto and NFTs have been some of the most meaningful of my life. 
If you have less than $10,000 invested in #crypto and you want to turn that into $100,000 or a $1,000,000 then don't buy #bitcoin. You need altcoins, especially low caps, to make that kind of money.
Like this tweet if you believe that #crypto is going to make you a millionaire!!!!

How much crypto skepticism comes from people hitting the age where they never want to have to understand a new technology ever again?
All the crypto influencers saying they aren't financial advisors are the ones making life changing gains, while real financial advisors are happy to get 10% per year
Between giant companies getting into NFTs, the constant new obsession with Metaverse, people hawking crypto, whatever the fuck Web3 is, and billionaires having active social media accounts where hundreds line up to kiss the ring, the internet.. kinda fucking sucks right now.
Scheduling this tweet to post exactly one year from now.

You can either invest in over valued crypto companies and hope someone else makes you rich. Luck.
My best advice if you’re starting a crypto project is to never, ever deliver. Empty promises are the best FA. Look at $XRP and $ADA. Over promise, under deliver, and never deliver. Then people always have something to look forward to. Delivering takes away hope
I can’t imagine how hard it must be juggling a full time job and crypto/nfts 🙇🏻‍♂️ keep on giving it your all, I’m rooting for you
You can fight crypto, but you cannot stop it. No one can.

If Discord is going to go into crypto shit to please their VC investors, them, as a company, are going to go bankrupt as soon as the crypto bubble bursts.
Discord touching crypto shit is a piss-off by itself but more fundamentally, I haaaate the way companies like that try to Expand for no fuckin' reason.
I've said this before, but like you know crypto is some wack impractical crap when porn didn't successfully jump on it and make it mainstream like 5 years ago.
so this is the discord CEO teasing some sort of crypto integration.
Ozzy Etomi hasn't realised that this isn't 2019 anymore. All those hate men men are scum bs aren't selling. People are doing crypto. Tech is trending. Elections are happening. People are growing up. Only impressionable &amp; fake-smart 20-something-year-olds fall for that be now.
If this is your first crypto bull market, hold on tight, your mind can’t even comprehend what you are about to experience.

How do you find the next 100x #altcoin? You don't. Chasing this goal is how most get rekt. Buy the high quality #crypto &amp; HODL until you get huge gains. You don't know when they'll pump. It could take days, weeks, months or years but if it's quality it will almost certainly pump.

If you dont like your job, know you can do better, and have enough saved in crypto to pay for 4 months expenses, convert to USDC, earn 7% on DeFi and go look for a job you like. There will never be a better time to be looking for a job than these next few months.
