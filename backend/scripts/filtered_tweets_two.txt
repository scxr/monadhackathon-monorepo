Man, looks like crypto is here to stay, just like every other business that ever bought a super bowl ad.
Token crypto itu pada dasarnya kan tech startup, yang dijual adalah teknologi dan atau utility.
Checking in with white feelings about the halftime show has been wild, y‚Äôall. It‚Äôs a freaking musical number to break up the monotony of crypto ads and Gladiatorial combat. 
Not to philosophize or whatever but y‚Äôall, there was a lot wrapped up in that Super Bowl. So much to be said &amp; written.
Ended up counting 7 total Super Bowl electric car related commercials:
Every crypto commercial has the desperation of ‚ÄúI gotta get more people to join my downline otherwise what am I gonna do with all these leggings?‚Äù
this crypto thing is going to be such a bloodbath. i feel like extremely unstable assets in a free for all market that is 95% scam and grift sold to regular humans as valuable secure investments by celebs on tv isn't a story that has any sort of good end
Both quarterbacks are hurt, a game-breaking receiver has left the game, a blown call has altered the outcome, one coach will not stop running the ball, Eminem has a beard, Larry David is selling crypto‚Ä¶
Celebrities starring in crypto ads should have to disclose if they were paid in crypto or in real money.
nobody: 
Ben Affleck doing gambling ads. Matt Damon doing crypto. I didn‚Äôt have the kids from Good Will Hunting rising to a stratospheric level of fame and fortune, and then choosing to pick the meat off the bones of what‚Äôs left of this economy.
‚ÄòTired of losing money on crypto? Perhaps online betting is for you.‚Äô
This is your reminder that 10% of Bitcoin owners have 99% of the bitcoins. They need new crypto buyers to be able to sell their holdings without tanking the market. All of these crypto ads are them trying to offload their position in the Ponzi scheme.
They‚Äôre really really putting millions of dollars into trying to get you to feel FOMO over crypto, huh? Can you think of a reasonable, worthwhile, durable investment that they had to beg regular folks to participate in?
Nice to see any CO2 emissions reduced by all these electric car ads will be offset by all the crypto ads
One reason I still have trouble believing crypto currency is money is that there aren‚Äôt commercials for money.
Lord of the Rings trailer ending with Gandalf turning to the camera and explaining that he gets his magic from crypto
All these celebrity crypto ads are destined for a supercut montage in the inevitable documentary after the recession

Feels illegal for there to be this many Crypto ads
The crypto ads this year are highly reminiscent of all the dot-com ads we saw in 2000, right before the market came crashing down.
You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself doing crypto ads
Larry David doing Crypto commercials gotta be some form of elder abuse.
Larry David doing crypto commercials. Damn. Knew that was coming at the end but still felt the full force of that L.
Larry David in a crypto ad is a pretty succinct answer to ‚ÄúIs it ever possible to have enough money?‚Äù

With inflation at 7.5%, you lose half your money in 9 years. The only way to outperform that consistently, that I have found, is crypto. Just this year I‚Äôve already lost half my money.

The relationships I've forged through crypto and NFTs have been some of the most meaningful of my life. 
If you have less than $10,000 invested in #crypto and you want to turn that into $100,000 or a $1,000,000 then don't buy #bitcoin. You need altcoins, especially low caps, to make that kind of money.
